DEG.Vimeo
==================

This module provides a simple integration with the [Vimeo Simple API](https://developer.vimeo.com/apis/simple)

# Features

1. Retrieve list of videos in an album

Yup, that's it for now. This module does very little, but it tries to do it very well.

# Motivation

This module was developed out of necessity. We had a need to retrieve a list of videos in a Vimeo album and most of the libraries available were more complex than we needed, and some (sadly) had a very high learning curve.

These are the primary goals for this project:

1. Simplicity: The library should be easy to use, and the API should be intuitive.
2. Stability: As with all software, it will fail sometimes. When it does, the cause should be known, and the remedy should be clear.
3. Readability: The code should be clean and well organized, so that others can enjoy it.

With that in mind, it only does exactly what we need it to, and no more. If you need it to do more, then please feel free to contribute! We will be actively monitoring, reviewing and merging pull requests.
