DEG.Social
==================
This is a collection of modules for simple integration with a number of social APIs.

# Libraries

1. Twitter

# Motivation

These are the primary goals for this project:
1. Simplicity
The library should be easy to use, and the API should be intuitive.
2. Stability
As with all software, it will fail sometimes. When it does, the cause should be known, and the remedy should be clear.
3. Readability
The code should be clean and well organized, so that others can enjoy it.

With that in mind, it only does exactly what we need it to, and no more. If you need it to do more, then please feel free to contribute! We will be actively monitoring, reviewing and merging pull requests.
